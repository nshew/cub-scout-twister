## Mat assembly
This project contains all the materials necessary to print and assemble your own
Cub Scout Twister mat.
1. Determine what size mat you will make. Use [Cub Scout Twister plan](./tiles/Cub%20Scout%20Twister%20plan.pdf) to help.
2. Print out the required amount of tiles and cut to square.
3. Line up your tiles in the order necessary for the current column.
4. Lay a strip of tape long enough for all the tiles in this column *plus spacing*.
5. Use a paint stick or ruler to maintain even spacing and alignment. See fig 1 ![fig 1](./tiles/fig1-mat-strip.jpg).
6. When the column is completed, lay it face down on the bottom of the drop cloth. Again, use a paint stick or yardstick to maintain spacing. See fig 2 ![fig 2](./tiles/fig2-mat-back.jpg).
7. Tape the other side of the tiles to prevent fanning or slipping. To save tape, you don't need to run one long strip.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for the required number of columns.
